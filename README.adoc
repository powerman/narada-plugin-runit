Narada plugin: runit
====================

This repo contains extra files needed to add service supervision using
http://smarden.org/runit/[runit] for Narada projects.

There are different sets of files available in different branches:

master:: plugin files which you should merge into your project

doc:: (this branch) no plugin files, only documentation about this repo

== Dependencies

You should have http://smarden.org/runit/[runit] installed (either
system-wide or in your home directory with it binaries available in
`$PATH`).

== Usage

Just create directories for services in `service/` and put there
executable `run` and `log/run` files for these services. All services will
be automatically started, and you can then control them using `sv
<COMMAND> ./service/<SERVICE>` in project's root directory.
